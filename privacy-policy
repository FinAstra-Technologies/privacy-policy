We do not collect any data or information from the users, we do not share the conversation with any third party, and we do not store any data or information on our servers.

Security

We take reasonable measures to protect your information from unauthorized access, use, or disclosure. However, please note that no internet transmission is ever completely secure or error-free. In particular, the chat sent to or from the App may not be secure.

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. If we make any changes to this Privacy Policy, we will notify you by revising the date at the top of this policy and, in some cases, by providing additional notice (such as adding a statement to our homepage or sending you a notification).
